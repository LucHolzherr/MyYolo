This is an older Coding Project where I implemented the original Yolo Bounding Box detector (paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) and trained it on the Pascal VOC dataset (http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/).
In the yolo-paper the network was pretrained on the imagenet dataset for image-classification. As I did not have the resources to do the same, I trained a slightly modified version: src/models/yolo_resnet.py which uses the pretrained resnet-18 model as a backbone and adds the bounding-box head of yolo-v1.
